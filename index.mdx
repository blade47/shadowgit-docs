## What is ShadowGit?

ShadowGit saves every keystroke you type and feeds your complete code history to AI assistants like Claude and Cursor via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

Your AI stops guessing. It knows exactly what worked before.

## How it works

ShadowGit runs quietly in the background, creating a parallel git repository (`.shadowgit.git`) that captures every save as a commit. The MCP server then gives your AI read-only access to this detailed history.

**New: AI Session Management** - ShadowGit automatically detects when you're working with AI tools and tracks your coding sessions, giving your AI assistant better context about your development patterns and recent changes.

## Real-world impact

- **Before**: Spend 15 minutes re-explaining your codebase to Claude
- **After**: Claude fixes the bug in 5 minutes using your code history

That's not marketing. That's math.
